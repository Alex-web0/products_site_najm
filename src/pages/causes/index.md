# Saya: Empowering Rights and Democracy

Saya is a non-governmental, national, and humanitarian organization dedicated to **human rights** and **democracy**. We are independent and nonprofit, officially registered on May 25, 2022, with the Department of Non-Governmental Organizations and the Federal Government in Baghdad under registration number 1HC2205043.

## Our Mission

Saya's mission is to defend and protect human rights, monitor violations, promote freedom of expression, prevent violent extremism, and advance women's rights in Iraq. We envision a future where human rights are upheld at the local and national levels in Iraq, and these rights are enforced across all sectors.

## Transforming Lives

We strive to transform the lives of children who have experienced harm, refugees, and workers, helping them reclaim their rights and achieve their dreams. Additionally, we work to raise awareness of women's rights, community cohesion, peacebuilding, reconciliation, conflict resolution, advocacy campaigns, human rights education, and the promotion of women's rights and freedom of speech.

## Our Team

In Salah Al-Din province and throughout Iraq, our team of over 24 members works closely with communities to address post-conflict violence and raise awareness among survivors and returnees from communities that were threatened by ISIS. Our headquarters are located in Salah Al-Din province.

## Empowering Communities

Our team actively strives to provide public awareness, protect women, and build stable and secure lives after conflicts while enforcing justice and equal rights. Our work empowers hundreds of individuals to know their rights and provides a brighter future for thousands of families, but there is still much more to be done.
